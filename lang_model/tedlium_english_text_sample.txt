so i dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of dr francine benes in the harvard department of psychiatry
what i hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about
i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for
when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat
so they came up with this plan this five point stimulation plan for the sows
to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed
at that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers eleven thousand times a second
so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit
so as you see people care about harm and care issues
so this syntax the at username that shaquille o'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans was completely invented by users and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier

net greenhouse gas emissions down eighty two percent in absolute tonnage
and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing
the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state much smaller than a single atom
this image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body
when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light
and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back so the squid doesn't make a shadow
we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors self as opposed to other
i interviewed when i was working on the book i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm she was part of a study at rutgers university
so what we added as a second element to our network is a battery swap system you drive
and i thought that was an idea worth spreading
and i thought that was an idea worth spreading
the brain isn't divided into compartments in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things
women lost their ancient jobs as collectors but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market
it doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor five nor six
but for some reason when it comes to the mental world when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stockmarkets we somehow forget the idea that we are limited
but here in africa you've got these nonlinear scaling fences
tell me he asked a friend why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating
she 's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a hut full of flies
it 's what's technically known as a barchan and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about seventeen meters per year
and the consensus was it really worked
and his life the transformation of his life from the deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death he become a linguist a trainer for the seventy six ers and now is a motivational speaker
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world or can we actually test for these extra dimensions
so we're going from machine to machine from page to page and now data to data
they tend to be web thinkers because the female parts of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns see more options and outcomes
einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that's what gravity is
now in economic theory cheating is a very simple cost benefit analysis
what you get from the present hedonism is the energy the energy to explore yourself places people sensuality
so i went out and researched ethanol
but one late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery
but one late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery
and finally depending on your particular version of european similarity you can think about the u k and france as either similar culturally or not
the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology
so what have we learned from this about cheating
that second foundation underlies the other thirty percent of the moral statements i've heard here at ted
and with these four letters you can create a language a language that can describe anything and very complicated things
now i said when i was in denmark my host was named anne marie and i said so why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig
in contrast i took a plate with six one dollar bills and i left those plates in the same refrigerators
we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing
when i say we i don't mean you necessarily i mean me and my right brain my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what i'm saying is wrong
this is an absolute miracle much harder to explain than the grand canyon
because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy
there is an uncertainty margin but we can see the difference here cambodia singapore
our only chance of long term survival is not to remain lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space

and as the movie says this is one smart puppy
and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around they'll be there in a second right there notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions
and i'll show you a little natural recursion here
i started off i came directly here from the deep deep tropical rainforest in ecuador where i was out you could only get there by a plane with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses
laughter so the big the answer to this question is simple pay four thousand bucks and come to ted or failing that do the eight things and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success

in madurai a reward that is modest in north american standards is more meaningful there
and i didn't want one frankly laughter but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other
some of you guys will fix that one day but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension goes smaller smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions
laughter yes i would love to have sophia loren's long legs and legendary breasts
and the beauty of this in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism
many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we'd quite literally create an infinite wall
and so every thing will be part of the web so every item every artifact that we make will have embedded in it some little sliver of web ness and connection and it will be part of this machine so that our environment kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense our environment becomes the web
areca palm is a plant which removes co two and converts it into oxygen
and similarly a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorenz contraction and so on to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking get children into the way of thinking about it
there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not
and that's because in middle world air friction is always there
a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain
so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different
art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance
they said yes it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another
i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith and people of no faith
and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra dimensions
that fixed behavior which is rigged and stereotyped and ends up with a meal changes
and of course it's the dna that counts so here's all the a t gs and cs that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics

we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression
jpl we heard this morning jpl is an incredible place
look around in this room all this knowledge energy talent and technology
i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be
i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be
what we find is that over these forty odd years that i and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes and as i say other mammals with complex brains and social systems we have found that after all there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom
he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found the unified theory
the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics
i thought oh my god maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers
international committee of medical journal editors
so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory it's not one extra dimension as in the older ideas of kaluza and klein
this happens to be ok he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom
real dependence on this person as one businessman in new york said to me he said anything she liked i liked
laughter anyway so basically roots and shoots is beginning to change young people's lives
let 's get off our fannies roll up our sleeves and get to work passionately in creating an almost perfect world
what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which i've depicted on this slide
so now in this new one when i link to it i would link to my particular flight my particular seat
so i was interested in these two rollers and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers
and people who are deliberating should i return it
once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors
some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas where it was and how much it cost and then appended the keyword atlgas so that other people search for that and find gas themselves
so here's a little fractal model for it
these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe
these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe
the history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe
but then if you think about it the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that
but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules
and i also said to her now these sows i mean you may have noticed there the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy
so what will follow is a student made film about just that
anyway he was really upset on the plane and he said i'll never find another girl like sarah
i didn't put his name up here my colleague kerry in kenya has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village it doesn't quite fit
and it's in there that those mini big bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year
my favorite being cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female but not the male
it 's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted
and when you don't understand really what's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that
you 've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in biology
your picture will be winging its way over the atlantic you will never see it again
this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest to us
the were run by an inexperienced staff with no visual culture no budgets for visual arts
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality
and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality
but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are at risk
and then the limbic system is activated when we see motion when we see color
the electron the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing the photon
but literally in the eight minutes he was talking there's about fifty tweets that already came on the talk
and what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them
i should mention that everything you're seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort
and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real
we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence
and i put them together so that in each pair of country one has twice the child mortality of the other
and i put them together so that in each pair of country one has twice the child mortality of the other
now how would you test a personal fudge factor
and this then led to my big questions
but for half the people i added an ugly version of jerry

my foot is covering approximately three hundred miles of mycelium
i think the most curious one that i came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth

give me x dollars a third of the people when they finished shredding the piece of paper they came to us and said mr experimenter i solved x problems
laughter and when he came out of the sanitarium he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself
but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better
this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful
when our ambition is bounded it leads us to work joyfully
laughter sports is to war as pornography is to sex
and of course there's developments in infrared so you can watch animals at night and equipment for recording by video and tape recording is getting lighter and better
the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence
let 's go for hip replacement but the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing
i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant
this was not idle curiosity doctor kinsey had heard and there was a theory kind of going around at the time this being the one thousand nine hundred and forty s that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility
am i telling you to not strive
what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule
again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape
to one group he said i'm going to time you to establish norms averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem
so the difference is is that rather than linking from page to page we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea rather than to the other page so every idea is basically being supported or every item or every noun is being supported by the entire web
when peter moves his arm that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter's mind taking place
you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline
and now they've got transport they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it
so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in those first generations of stars which then ran out of fuel exploded threw those elements back into the universe
but if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done
as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better the performance

we have diverted one hundred and forty eight million pounds that's seventy four thousand tons of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started fourteen years ago
we call it mycophobia the irrational fear of the unknown when it comes to fungi
now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation
you get some sense of the size you can just see these eu standard size people underneath
miracles are just events that are extremely improbable
this is what's really complicated that there were people living in places like the grand canyon cooperating with each other or on the savannahs of africa or on the frozen shores of alaska and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of babylon and rome and tenochtitlan
in the san fransisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it's called the other car
the best definition of innateness i've ever seen this just clarifies so many things for me is from the brain scientist gary marcus
there 's a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child
we have now entered in the six x the sixth major extinction on this planet
and she went to a neurologist who was fascinated he checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste
even in places like india and japan where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market they're moving into journalism
laughter but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside
so we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders the high tech leaders particularly google and nasa
sousa 's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these quote infernal machines
and so i honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages that time is now
and if you think about it all these different societies have different geometric design themes they use
but this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet because in enron there's also a social element
the whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team
then you harvest the seeds and thank you eric rasmussen for your help on this and then you're harvesting the seed garden
i now turn to the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe

and the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second
i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity
now the second issue that i want to finish up with is how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly
but it turns out that from organ donation they are very different
and about a year ago an internet dating service match com came to me and asked me if i would design a new dating site for them
and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic and i was trying to encourage them somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi if you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good
stuart brown so i would encourage you all to engage not in the work play differential where you set aside time to play but where your life becomes infused minute by minute hour by hour with body object social fantasy transformational kinds of play
so these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly
laughter unaided human intuition schooled in middle world finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant
we think they must be blinded by religion or by simple stupidity
and indeed once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of africa a million years ago because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today
so you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels and a car as a chip with wheels
shoots seem tiny but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls
they started low they skyrocketed they peaked up there in two thousand and three and now they are down
then we adjust the content accordingly
it took me eight years to completely recover
now we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made
that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personed space flight
that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personed space flight
what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all
so i am very interested from the beginning that how how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures and how we use these objects can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world
or have they got longer lives and live up there
or have they got longer lives and live up there
and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of dr francine benes in the harvard department of psychiatry
so kaluza said to himself einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe i can play the same game with the other known force which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about
but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts big and small
botswana upper middle income country in southern africa democratic government good economy and this is what happened there
you 're huge what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host
and these projects will continue past these sessions using collaborative interactive communication
and it was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse

about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that is not going to be the path to go
what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions across all faiths across all continents a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be rectified
in denmark we will drive all the cars in denmark from windmills not from oil
suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal
what 's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions
so some of these things i'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people what's the algorithm
my father was a baptist minister and he believed in miracles and that god's will would take care of that
and when we see cheating around us particularly if it's a part of our in group cheating goes up

this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join
oh yeah right you really didn't have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face
and so for tasks like this a narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well
and so for tasks like this a narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well
so the roots and shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects
science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense
they live life knowing they live it against the law
it makes me really feel that that civilization which as i say if you believe the scientific creation story has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics and a few hydrogen atoms then i think to me anyway it makes me feel incredibly valuable
but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars
so this is very conscious knowledge
then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer toilet brush toothpick beautiful toilet seats and why not a toothbrush

now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability
you do find groups in the animal kingdom you do find cooperative groups but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings
but as my son max grows up in a liberal college town how is this first draft going to get revised
i love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccupers could try masturbation laughter i love that because there is like a whole demographic
i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based on mycelium
and actually seven hundred and change million cars today emit two point eight billion tons of co two
there 's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another
we also then went to look at what are these molecules these were the red triangles on my slides before
so the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere i think is a foregone conclusion at least in my own mind
i heard a little voice saying ok you muscles you gotta contract
look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper
that culprit is business and industry
but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity he'd been unable to figure out how it really works
that 's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we've actually experienced since i was a student
so what's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox and we find that this toolbox is very extensive
and i'm saying humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine in a certain sense so we have a trillion eyes and ears and touches through all our digital photographs and cameras
and they do something incredibly cool
the twenty percent poorest of niger is out here and the twenty percent richest of south africa is there and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa
