\subsection{ Stage 6 - Feature Extraction }


In this stage, MFCC features are extracted for all the 3 data partitions (test, dev, and train) 
using the \texttt{steps/make\_mfcc.sh} script on the data placed in the \texttt{data/<\$set>} 
($\$set = {test,dev,train}$) directories. It uses the \texttt{compute-mfcc-feats} command-line tool
to produce the required MFCC features. A broad overview~\cite{mfcc} of the MFCC feature extractions is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Work out the number of frames in the file (typically 25 ms frames shifted by 10ms each time).
    \item For each frame: 
        \begin{itemize}
         \item Extract the data, do optional dithering, preemphasis and dc offset removal, and multiply it by a windowing function.
         \item Calculate the energy (negative log), do FFT and compute the power spectrum.
         \item Compute log of the energy in each mel bin and take cosine transform keeping the required number of coefficients.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Further, cepstral mean and variance statistics (CMVN)~\cite{kaldicmvn} per speaker are computed for all the 3 data partitions using the \path{steps/compute_cmvn_stats.sh} script which helps in compensation of noise and reduces mismatch between different data partitions.
