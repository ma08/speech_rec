\subsection{ Stage 19 - Rescore Lattices (Pruned Algorithm)}
This is the last stage of the pipeline. The script \path{rnnlm/lmrescore_pruned.sh} is run to rescore lattices with Kaldi RNNLM using a pruned algorithm~\cite{8461974}. This algorithm improves the n-gram approximation
method. The pruned algorithm further limits the search space and uses heuristic search to pick better histories when expanding the lattice. It achieves better ASR accuracies while running much
faster than the standard algorithm.
